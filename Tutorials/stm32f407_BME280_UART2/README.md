# STM32 BME280 Sensor Data Logger

## Description
This project is an STM32-based data logger that reads temperature, humidity, and pressure data from a BME280 sensor and transmits it over UART.

## Requirements
- STM32CubeIDE or compatible IDE
- STM32 board (specific model not specified)
- BME280 sensor
- Additional hardware components (if any)
- [Any additional dependencies or requirements]

## Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone 
    ```
2. Open the project in STM32CubeIDE.
3. Configure your STM32 board and connect the BME280 sensor to the appropriate pins.
4. Build and flash the project to your STM32 board.

## Usage
1. Ensure that the BME280 sensor is properly connected to the STM32 board.
2. Power on the STM32 board.
3. Open a serial terminal (e.g., PuTTY, Tera Term) and connect to the UART port configured in the project.
4. You should start receiving temperature, humidity, and pressure data transmitted over UART at regular intervals.
